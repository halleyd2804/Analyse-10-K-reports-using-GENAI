**- Company: ORCL:**

             - **Ranking:** Bullish
             - **Explanation:** Oracle acknowledges AI risks, but its opportunities are clearly outlined through the integration of AI into its core products and services (Oracle Autonomous Database, OCI). Although the exact AI investment amount isn't specified, the substantial R&D spending (a portion of which is implicitly allocated to AI) and explicit mention of AI integration points to a bullish outlook.  The estimate of 24.7B USD in investment value is not enough to override a bullish assessment of the company's active engagement in the industry.
